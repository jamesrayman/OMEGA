Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

All entries are two or more lines. The first line is the name of the type of
number (title), always in all uppercase. The rest of the lines are the
description of the type of number (body), in sentence case. Entries are
terminated by a single '#'.

Titles are one line. Bodies are at most 8 lines. Each line is at most 26
characters.

C escape codes are permitted.

Entries begin after the '~' and end after the '#'
